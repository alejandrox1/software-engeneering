# Notes API

This is an example application to store notes in a
[MongDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB) instance.

The app and the database are layed out for interactive use.

Before you run the app, you'll need to have mongo up and running.
For instructions on how to do this see 
[MongoDB in a container](./mongodb/README.md).

For instructions on how to start the app see the 
[server/README](./server/README.md).
